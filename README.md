# Book-My-DJ_Front-End

This is my very first front-end development project, where I created a basic booking website for a DJ service. Though the project had some issues initially, it marks the starting point of my learning journey in web development.

## ðŸš€ Project Highlights:
- **Simple Design**: Basic structure for a DJ booking platform.
- **Learning Milestone**: Focused on HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript.
- **Continuous Improvement**: I have since learned and improved my skills in front-end development.

This project is a great reminder of how far Iâ€™ve come with continuous learning and hands-on practice. ðŸŽ¶
